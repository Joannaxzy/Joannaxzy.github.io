I am a second year master stundent at the [University of Washington Biostatistics Department](https://www.biostat.washington.edu/). 

My passion for biomedical sciences can be traced back to my undergraduate experience where I spent significant time conducting research on neuropharmacology and pharmacoInformatics in the [College of Pharmaceutical Sciences at Zhejiang University](http://cpsen.zju.edu.cn/_t2140/main.psp) under the guidance of [Xiangnan Zhang](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/zhangxn#921079) , [Feng Zhu](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/zhufeng) respectively.

In my senior year, I got the opportunity to complete my undergraduate study research on NeuroAIDS as an exchange student in the [College of Pharmacy at University of South Carolina](https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/pharmacy/index.php) in [Jun Zhu's Lab](https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/pharmacy/faculty-staff/zhu_jun.php). 

I love data analysis, programming and statistics. At present, I have gained strong programming skill sets through multiple courseworks, internships and research projects (check [here](TBD)). And I had experience in applying quantitative solutions to drive biomedical results.

I am always motivated by the combination of quantitative science and biomedical studies. Therefore, I choose to expand my skills and to ultimate return to industry after graduation. 

In the summer of 2019, I completed my internship at [Novartis](https://www.novartis.com/). In  Working in a four-person team to developed enhanced annotation of the association between transcription factors and ultimate disease through data integration and prediction. She was fortunate to present her teamâ€™s work to an interdisciplinary audience at the end of her internship and this increased her awareness of the importance of clear communication of technical material to a general audience.
